# Concept

The idea behind this library is to provide the necessary glue code to generate form interfaces with [React Final Form](https://final-form.org/react)
for the view data of [Symfony Form](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/form.html) as it is provided by [Pitch Liform](https://github.com/ph-fritsche/liform).

__Liform React Final__ aims to be agnostic about the actual representation and offer easy customization while paving the *happy path* to display Symfony Forms with React.
